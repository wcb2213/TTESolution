Tasks: designed the TTE demonstration system, realized three functions: database connection, LAN communication and data visualization
Work and functions achieved:
1. Sending end: Design software interface. Connect to database and realize basic functions (add, delete, modify and display). Dynamic data can be generated based on parameters and saved to the database.Parameters can be saved to and read from configuration files (code only for this part)
2. Transmission: use Socket UDP communication to transmit database data. (haven't upload yet)
3. Receiving end: design software interface and realize data visualization, including bar chart, trajectories and latitude and longitude map. (haven't upload yet)
